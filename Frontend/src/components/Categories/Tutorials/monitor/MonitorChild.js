                            <h4>Key Reasons to Monitor Your Child’s Cell Phone</h4>

                        <p>One of the main reasons most parents would like to track their children’s cell phones is because they are mainly responsible for the safety and well-being of their kids. It may take hours to wonder what your teens are doing with their smartphones. Therefore, parents want to track their kids’ cell phones to make the upbringing process simpler and more effective.<br/><br/>
                         According to a recent <Link to="https://www.dqinstitute.org/impact-measure/"> DQ Institute survey</Link> about Internet dangers for children, 6 out of 10 kids aged 8-12 face various online risks. Additionally, one in two kids suffer from cyberbullying, and about one-third of children experience cyber threats: hacking or phishing.
                          The statistics speak for themselves. For example, the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center reported that in 2020 cyber crime against children increased by 144% contrasted to 2019. It means eight children per day experience numerous online risks.</p>
